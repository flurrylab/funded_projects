Monorepo for FlurryLab-funded projects

Flurrylab is an NGO registered in California with a mission to promote tech education to Chinese-speaking individuals. This repository hosts educational and toy projects that support our students as they learn technology. Students contribute their own work, collaborate with us, and seek advisory support through these projects.
